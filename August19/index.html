" Password Strength Meter — Coding Task
🕒 Time Limit: 20 minutes
📄 Tech: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks)
🧠 Task
Build a simple password strength checker component.
When the user types into the password field, a visual indicator should update in real-time to reflect the strength of the entered password.

✅ Requirements
Create a password input field.
Add a strength indicator that dynamically updates as the user types.
Use at least the following strength rules:

Weak: Less than 6 characters
Medium: At least 6 characters and includes letters + numbers
Strong: At least 8 characters and includes letters, numbers, and special characters
The strength level should be clearly visible using color or text (e.g., red for weak, orange for medium, green for strong).

🌟 Bonus Points
Add a short textual message below the input like:
“Too weak”, “Could be stronger”, “Strong password”
Animate or smoothly transition the strength indicator.
Style the component to look clean and responsive.
Add a show/hide toggle for the password input."
