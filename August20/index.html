Question:

In a bustling city, two software engineers, Alex and Jamie, are working on a new project for their tech startup. Their task is to optimize the logistics of pairing volunteers for a community event. The volunteers are represented as an array of integers, where each integer corresponds to the amount of work they can handle. Alex and Jamie need to find pairs of volunteers whose combined work capacity matches a specific target sum. This will ensure that tasks are evenly distributed among the pairs.

Your task is to write a function that, given an array of integers representing the work capacity of volunteers and a target sum, returns a list of unique pairs of indices whose corresponding values sum up to the target.

Example1:
    Input:  4
            1 2 3 4
            5
    Output  0 3 1 2
    Explanation: Pairs(1, 4) and (2, 3) sum to 5.
Example2:   
    Input:  5
            2 4 6 8 10
            12
    Output: 1 3 0 4
    Explanation: Pairs(4, 8) and (2, 10) sum to 12.
