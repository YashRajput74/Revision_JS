Isomorphic Strings Puzzle:
In a small town, two friends, Alice and Bob, love playing word games. One evening, they came across a fascinating challenge involving isomorphic strings. An isomorphic string is one where characters in one string can be uniquely mapped to corresponding characters in another string, maintaining the order and structure. Alice, intrigued by the concept, decided to create a game where she provides two strings, and Bob has to determine if they are isomorphic.
Your task is to help Bob by writing a function that takes two strings as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the two strings are isomorphic.

Function Signature:
def are_isomorphic(s: str, t: str) -> bool:

Input:
s: a string representing the first word.
t: a string representing the second word.

Output:
Return true if the two strings are isomorphic, otherwise return false.
Example:
For instance, if Alice gives the strings "egg" and "add", Bob should determine they are isomorphic because 'e' maps to 'a' and 'g' maps to 'd'. However, the strings "foo" and "bar" are not isomorphic since there isn't a one-to-one mapping between characters.

Example1:
Input: egg add
Output: true
Explanation: Each character in 'egg' can be mapped to a unique character in 'add'

Example2:
Input: ab cs
Output: true
Explanation: Characters in 'ab' can be uniquely mapped to 'cs'
